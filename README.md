# Find-Amicable-Numbers

This is a script that finds all combinations of amicable numbers up to a given input.
Amicable numbers are pairs whose divisors (including 1 but not the number) add to the other number.

The script will also find perfect numbers up (all of the divisors including 1 but not the number add up to the number itself) to and including the given limit. It could be easily modified not to include these numbers.

As written the script does not use an "input" command. The user must run the findFriends method and supply the desired input directly.
